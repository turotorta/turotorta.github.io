I was born in Shenyang, China, a city rich with history, once the imperial capital of the Qing dynasty and still known for its resilience and reinvention. At 18, I moved alone to Budapest, Hungary to study mathematics at the country’s top technical university. It was a bold choice, but not a random one.

Math taught me how to structure problems. Psychology, which I pursued next, taught me how people actually behave inside those structures. And an MBA helped me bridge both worlds into strategy.

After graduation and some years of working in Budapest, I made another deliberate move, and this time to Berlin, under the EU Blue Card. It was a lifestyle choice, yes, but also a strategic one. I believe in placing myself where long-term value and personal growth align.

Every pivot I’ve made, from country to career has been intentional. I don’t chase titles. I seek clarity, challenge, and creative control. Today, that means leaning further into strategy consulting, where the right decisions make the biggest difference.

Also: I’m a Mensa member in the Hungarian Chapter, a mother, and someone who thinks the best ideas often start with “what if we didn’t follow the rules?”
