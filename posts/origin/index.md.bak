I was born in Shenyang, a northern city in China that once served as the imperial capital of the Qing dynasty. Today, it’s known for its industrial strength and resilience, traits I carry with me in how I think, work, and move through life. I had a supportive family and a childhood filled with curiosity, patterns, and music. I started playing the piano when I was three, and even at that age, I was drawn to complexity, both in sound and in thought.

By the time I was in high school, I already knew I wanted to explore the world beyond. I didn’t just want to study abroad, I wanted to live, grow, and be shaped by unfamiliar systems and cultures. At 18, I moved alone to Budapest, Hungary, to study mathematics at BME, the country’s leading technical university. It was a bold decision, but not an impulsive one. I had mapped it out, step by step, driven by a desire for challenge, independence, and perspective.

Budapest became my training ground, not just academically, but in life. I learned how to navigate a foreign language, culture, and bureaucracy. I made friends from all over the world, had long conversations over cheap coffees, and experienced both deep joy and quiet isolation. Those years were formative. I began to understand not only how to adapt, but also how to grow roots wherever I landed.

When the COVID pandemic hit, the city slowed down and so did I. I spent long evenings reflecting, studying, and rediscovering music. I bought a digital keyboard and returned to the piano after years away. Practicing Rachmaninoff’s emotionally demanding works became a ritual, it reminded me that creativity often begins in constraint. That time also shaped how I respond to crises: with structure, calm, and a bit of soul.

After graduation, I challenged myself in new ways. I took and passed the Mensa Hungary admission test, discovering I was among the top 1%. Around the same time, I also juggled work and driving practice, waking up early to train with my instructor. After three months of disciplined effort, I finally passed my driver’s exam, another small but meaningful milestone in building a fully independent life.

After several years in Budapest, I knew it was time for the next step. I planned and executed a relocation to Berlin, under the EU Blue Card program. Five years in Hungary had taught me a lot, but I was ready for new energy, a city that felt faster, bolder, and more aligned with where I wanted to go next. I approached the move like a strategist. As a minimalist, I didn’t want to deal with complicated logistics, so I shipped my piano and suitcase a month ahead using BlaBlaCar. It was unconventional and slightly risky, but it worked!

Berlin was a shift. The pace, the people, the politics, everything felt sharper and more unapologetic. The city challenged me to open up, to think in new layers, to speak in a new language (literally). I embraced the discomfort. I learned German and, within just 21 months, secured permanent residency. For the first time, I felt fully settled.

But I didn’t stop there. I enrolled in a Master’s degree in Psychology, driven by my lifelong interest in understanding how people think, feel, and act. Later, I added an MBA to the mix, because I was ready to tie everything together. Math taught me to break down problems and see structure in chaos; psychology gave me insight into human behavior within those systems; and business showed me how to move from insight to strategy, and from planning to action.

Every pivot I’ve made, whether across countries or disciplines, has been intentional. I don’t chase titles or trends. I seek clarity. I value strategy. And I’m always building toward a version of work and life that is uniquely my own.
