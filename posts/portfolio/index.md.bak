**AI Advertising & Brand Loyalty Research Study (2025)**

*Led a study examining brand perception and loyalty between AI-generated and traditional ads.*

It compares traditionally produced vs. AI-generated ads across three key dimensions: trust, innovation, and perceived value—and examines how these factors predict loyalty.

> Early questions include: Do AI-generated ads feel less trustworthy? More innovative? Just as valuable?

> The research aims to offer practical insights for brands integrating AI into marketing—and test whether artificial creativity builds or breaks consumer relationships.
