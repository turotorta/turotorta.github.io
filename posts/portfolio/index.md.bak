**🧠 AI Advertising & Brand Loyalty Research Study (2025)**

*Led a study examining brand perception and loyalty between AI-generated and traditional ads.*

> This study explores how AI-generated ads influence consumer perception and brand loyalty, using Coca-Cola commercials as a controlled case. It compares traditionally produced vs. AI-generated ads across three key dimensions: trust, innovation, and perceived value—and examines how these factors predict loyalty.

> Early questions include: Do AI-generated ads feel less trustworthy? More innovative? Just as valuable?

> The research aims to offer practical insights for brands integrating AI into marketing—and test whether artificial creativity builds or breaks consumer relationships.

> Findings showed that individuals high in Machiavellianism were more sensitive to AI-related threats, while those high in psychopathy were more optimistic about AI technology.

> The study offers early insight into how personality shapes public responses to AI—and how we might craft smarter communication strategies around it.
