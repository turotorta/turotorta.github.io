***"I design strategies that think for themselves"***

I'm Alessia, a strategist, project leader, and multidisciplinary thinker.

I work at the intersection of structure, insight, and execution. With a background in mathematics, psychology, and business, I bring a multidimensional approach to solving complex problems—one that balances logic with intuition, and systems thinking with human behavior.

Professionally, I’ve navigated fast-moving environments in IT consulting and project management, where clear thinking and strategic clarity are essential. Whether I’m mapping out solutions, leading projects, or translating between technical and business teams, I aim to make things work—efficiently and intelligently.

I thrive in ambiguity, ask sharp questions, and believe strategy isn’t just a department—it’s a mindset.
