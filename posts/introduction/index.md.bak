***"I design strategies that think for themselves"***

I'm Alessia, a strategist, project leader, and multidisciplinary thinker.

My background blends math, psychology, and business, and Iâ€™ve worked across borders in IT consulting and digital transformation.

I lead with clarity, think in systems, and deliver work that moves things forward.
