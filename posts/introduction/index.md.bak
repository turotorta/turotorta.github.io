***"I design strategies that think for themselves"***

I'm Alessia, part strategist, part behavior hacker, part leader. 

With a background in mathematics, psychology, and business, I move across disciplines to solve problems others can’t see. I’ve led IT transformations, product launches, and many strategic initiatives.

I don’t just manage complexity, I translate it into momentum.


Based in Berlin.
