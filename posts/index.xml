&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Advertising &amp;amp; Brand Loyalty Research Study (2025)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Led a study examining brand perception and loyalty between AI-generated and traditional ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explores how AI-generated ads influence consumer perception and brand loyalty, using Coca-Cola commercials as a controlled case. It compares traditionally produced vs. AI-generated ads across three key dimensions: trust, innovation, and perceived value‚Äîand examines how these factors predict loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early questions include: Do AI-generated ads feel less trustworthy? More innovative? Just as valuable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research aims to offer practical insights for brands integrating AI into marketing‚Äîand test whether artificial creativity builds or breaks consumer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Triad √ó AI Perception Research Study (2024)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Led a study examining individual differences and perception of AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explored how personality traits‚Äîspecifically Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy‚Äîinfluence how people perceive AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings showed that individuals high in Machiavellianism were more sensitive to AI-related threats, while those high in psychopathy were more optimistic about AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study offers early insight into how personality shapes public responses to AI‚Äîand how we might craft smarter communication strategies around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Shenyang, a northern city in China that once served as the imperial capital of the Qing dynasty. Today, it‚Äôs known for its industrial strength and resilience, traits I carry with me in how I think, work, and move through life. I had a supportive family and a childhood filled with curiosity, patterns, and music. I started playing the piano when I was three, and even at that age, I was drawn to complexity, both in sound and in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I was in high school, I already knew I wanted to explore the world beyond. I didn‚Äôt just want to study abroad, I wanted to live, grow, and be shaped by unfamiliar systems and cultures. At 18, I moved alone to Budapest, Hungary, to study mathematics at BME, the country‚Äôs leading technical university. It was a bold decision, but not an impulsive one. I had mapped it out, step by step, driven by a desire for challenge, independence, and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://turotorta.github.io/images/Budapest.JPEG&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budapest became my training ground, not just academically, but in life. I learned how to navigate a foreign language, culture, and bureaucracy. I made friends from all over the world, had long conversations over cheap coffees, and experienced both deep joy and quiet isolation. Those years were formative. I began to understand not only how to adapt, but also how to grow roots wherever I landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://turotorta.github.io/images/Budapest2.JPEG&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the COVID pandemic hit, the city slowed down and so did I. I spent long evenings reflecting, studying, and rediscovering music. I bought a digital keyboard and returned to the piano after years away. Practicing Rachmaninoff‚Äôs emotionally demanding works became a ritual, it reminded me that creativity often begins in constraint. That time also shaped how I respond to crises: with structure, calm, and a bit of soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://turotorta.github.io/images/Piano.JPEG&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation, I challenged myself in new ways. I took and passed the Mensa Hungary admission test, discovering I was among the top 1%. Around the same time, I also juggled work and driving practice, waking up early to train with my instructor. After three months of disciplined effort, I finally passed my driver‚Äôs exam, another small but meaningful milestone in building a fully independent life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several years in Budapest, I knew it was time for the next step. I planned and executed a relocation to Berlin, under the EU Blue Card program. Five years in Hungary had taught me a lot, but I was ready for new energy, a city that felt faster, bolder, and more aligned with where I wanted to go next. I approached the move like a strategist. As a minimalist, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with complicated logistics, so I shipped my piano and suitcase a month ahead using BlaBlaCar. It was unconventional and slightly risky, but it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berlin was a shift. The pace, the people, the politics, everything felt sharper and more unapologetic. The city challenged me to open up, to think in new layers, to speak in a new language (literally). I embraced the discomfort. I learned German and, within just 21 months, secured permanent residency. For the first time, I felt fully settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://turotorta.github.io/images/Berlin.JPEG&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; height=&#34;80%&#34;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn‚Äôt stop there. I enrolled in a Master‚Äôs degree in Psychology, driven by my lifelong interest in understanding how people think, feel, and act. Later, I added an MBA to the mix, because I was ready to tie everything together. Math taught me to break down problems and see structure in chaos; psychology gave me insight into human behavior within those systems; and business showed me how to move from insight to strategy, and from planning to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every pivot I‚Äôve made, whether across countries or disciplines, has been intentional. I don‚Äôt chase titles or trends. I seek clarity. I value strategy. And I‚Äôm always building toward a version of work and life that is uniquely my own.&lt;/p&gt;
